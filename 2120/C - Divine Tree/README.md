## Problem Statement

<div class="header"><div class="title">C. Divine Tree</div><div class="time-limit"><div class="property-title">time limit per test</div>2 seconds</div><div class="memory-limit"><div class="property-title">memory limit per test</div>256 megabytes</div><div class="input-file input-standard"><div class="property-title">input</div>standard input</div><div class="output-file output-standard"><div class="property-title">output</div>standard output</div></div><div><p>  </p><p>Harshith attained enlightenment in Competitive Programming by training under a Divine Tree. A divine tree is a rooted tree$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ with $$$n$$$ nodes, labelled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The divineness of a node $$$v$$$, denoted $$$d(v)$$$, is defined as the smallest node label on the unique simple path from the root to node $$$v$$$.</p><p>Aryan, being a hungry Competitive Programmer, asked Harshith to pass on the knowledge. Harshith agreed on the condition that Aryan would be given two positive integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$, and he had to construct a divine tree with $$$n$$$ nodes such that the total divineness of the tree is $$$m$$$, i.e., $$$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^n d(i)=m$$$. If no such tree exists, Aryan must report that it is impossible.</p><p>Desperate for knowledge, Aryan turned to you for help in completing this task. As a good friend of his, help him solve the task.</p><div class="statement-footnote"><p>$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$A tree is a connected graph without cycles.
